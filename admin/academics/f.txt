The presented course page facilitates efficient course management within an academic context. It ensures that only authenticated users have access, promoting data security and integrity. The course page operates in conjunction with a database, aiding in the creation and organization of courses.

Upon accessing the page, user authentication is verified through a session check. This ensures that only authorized users, typically administrators, can access the course management functionality. If authentication fails, the course page redirects the user to a login page.

The course page includes a form to add new courses to the system. When a course name is submitted, the course page validates the input to ensure that the course name is not empty. If the input is valid, the course page inserts the new course into a 'courses' table in the database. This enhances organization and tracking of courses offered within the academic institution. After a successful insertion, the page is refreshed to display the updated list of courses.

Furthermore, the course page retrieves the existing courses from the database and presents them in a tabular format. Each course entry is displayed alongside options to edit or delete the course. These actions provide administrators with the ability to maintain an accurate and up-to-date record of courses. When selecting the edit option, the user is directed to a separate page where they can modify course details. Similarly, the delete option allows administrators to remove courses that are no longer relevant or offered.

In conclusion, this course page streamlines course management within an academic system. It ensures that courses are efficiently added, edited, and removed from the database while maintaining a secure and authenticated environment for administrators. However, to ensure robustness and user-friendliness, additional features such as error handling, input validation, and confirmation prompts for delete actions are recommended.
